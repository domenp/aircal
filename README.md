Update: The library is not actively maintained. In case of issues, you might be on your own. However, you're free to open a PR :)

# Aircal

This library helps visualizing Airflow's DAG run schedule. It does that by exporting future DAG runs as events to Google Calendar.

Having DAG run as events in the calendar might help you:
- visualize the utilization of your airflow workers to better spread your jobs
- determine when a certain DAG should be finished to monitor the service.

The library will also observe the changes to your DAGs and synchronize it with the calendar:
- add runs for the freshly added DAGs
- change start and/or end time when an existing DAG changes the schedule (or the execution time changes significantly)
- delete run events when a DAG is removed (or paused)

Tip: run the sync script regularly, perhaps, with you know, Airflow :)

The library only support DAG schedules that use the standard cron syntax. The rest will be ignored (with a warning).

**Warning: This is an beta stage software. Expect occassional bugs and rough edges (PR welcome).**

## Installation & setup

```
pip install aircal
```

Alternatively you can clone the repo and install it from there:

```
pip install -e .
```

Google API credentials are required to create events in the calendar. You can obtain them [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials). Store `credentials.json` into a directory accessible by your code.

**The library is modifying and deleting calendar events. I highly recommend creating a new calendar to be used by this software:** "add calendar" -> "create new calendar" in Google calendar settings.

## Usage

See `example.py` for an example of the potential pipeline that can be run on the regular intervals.
